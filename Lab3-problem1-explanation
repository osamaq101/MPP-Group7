 * Explanation:
 * The equals() method that was declared in the Person class was implemented by
 * only comparing the "name" field while the PersonWithJob class was comparing
 * both "name" and "salary" which will not be equal when comparing PersonWithJob
 * to Person.Therefore,
 * p1.equals(p2) is false (since p2 doesn't have a "salary"). Where as
 * p2.equals(p1) it is true since when checking the equals inside the Person
 * class it is only checking the "name" property which is same in this case.
